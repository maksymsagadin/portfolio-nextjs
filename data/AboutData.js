	intro: 'Working as an Application Administrator exposed me to HTML and inspired me to learn more about code and programming so I enrolled into De Anza College to study computer programming. There, I studied C++, Python and Data Structures. In one of my classes, we used a graphic user interface in our coding assignment and that was my initial spark for front end development.',
	description:
		'After realizing my passion for front end development, I completed a freelance front end developer bootcamp called Freemote. At Freemote, I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, as well as building Responsive layouts, Mobile First design and e-commerce development with Shopify. Now I am looking for opportunities in front end web development to grow my career and skills.',
